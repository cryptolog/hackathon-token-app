# CryptoGive Token Hackathon App

CryptoGive is the missing link between cryptocurrency and charitable giving. Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies like it are growing at an exponential rate but charitable organizations lack the technology, confidence, and understanding to accept cryptocurrency as payment. At CryptoGive our mission is to use this new form of currency for good. The annual market size of charitable giving totals to over $398 billion in the United States alone. We work with two market leaders, OrgHunter and MakeMyDonation, to provide an easy platform for cryptocurrency users to donate. Through this partnership, this groundbreaking application will instantly expose 1.5 million US-based charities to an untapped revenue source and will ever-change cryptoâ€™s role in the vast world of philanthropy. Our goal is to create a positive image for cryptocurrency.

## Architecture

Deploying a Token app requires a few processes to run:

* **token-headless-client**<br>
  This is a client we provide (similar to the iOS or Android client) that provides a wrapper around the Token backend services. It also handles end-to-end encrypting all messages using the Signal protocol. It is written in Java and runs in the background, proxying all the requests to amd from your bot.
* **redis**<br>
  We use redis pub/sub to provide a connection between the token-headless-client and your bot.
* **bot.js**<br>
  This is where all your app logic lives.
* **postgres**<br>
  Postgres is used to store session data so you can persist state for each user who talks to your bot (similar to cookies in a web browser).
